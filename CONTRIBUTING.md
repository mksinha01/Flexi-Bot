## Working with AI Models

### Adding New Models
When adding support for new AI models:
1. Create a new file following the pattern `<model_name>.py`
2. Implement the same interface as existing models
3. Update the main app.py to include the new model option
4. Test thoroughly with various PDF types

### Model-Specific Guidelines
- **Claude**: Best for detailed analysis and medical documents
- **Llama 3**: Good for general purpose document Q&A
- Ensure prompts are optimized for each model's strengths

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update this CONTRIBUTING.md if you change development processes

## Community
